üßë Our patreon system is super simple: you give **$5/month** to the project to help IFC.js keep growing. However, **we don't believe that open source should depend on altruistic donations**. For this reason, all patreons gain access to the following:

<Card icon="üë©‚Äçüè´" title="BIM programming courses for all levels">
	We have BIM programming courses for all levels. Each course cost $100, but patreons can access
	them{' '}
	<a href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Courses/Getting-started#for-patreons">at just $25</a>.

```js
function main() {
	console.log('boom');
}

main();

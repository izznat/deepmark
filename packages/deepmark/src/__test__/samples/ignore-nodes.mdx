<Card icon="👩‍🏫" title="BIM programming courses for all levels">
	We have BIM programming courses for all levels. Each course cost $100, but patreons can access
	them{' '}
	<a href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Courses/Getting-started#for-patreons">at just $25</a>.
</Card>

```js
function main() {
	console.log('boom');
}

main();
```
